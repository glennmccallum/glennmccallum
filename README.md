- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @glennmccallum

- ðŸ‘€ I love to solve problems! 15+ years experience as a Network Engineer specialising in Routing, Switching, Security, IPTel, Scripting & Automation.
I also love clean design and building websites as well as automating and creating tools to help with roles in Network Engineering/ Network Operations
Here are some technical knowledge bytes I found interesting along my journey and hope to help any others on similar path.
